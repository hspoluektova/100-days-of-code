# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 04, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:Setup GitHub profile, add support for rest api in NodeJS app.

**Thoughts:** I've prepared template and schema for creating rest api controllers in future. But I still need to improve this aproach

### Day 2: June 05, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: added /users method on the backend, created user.service and userlist.component on the frontend Angular app

**Thoughts:** I still need to make html part of userlist component. List of connected  users is not on the page yet

### Day 3: June 06, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: display users in user list as circles of random color filled with first letters of user name

**Thoughts:** Need to refactor user list as service. It will allow simple work with user list when socket events will raise (new user connect, some user disconnect)

### Day 5: June 08, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Implemented one integration test for method returning connected user list using mocha chai and supertest. 

**Thoughts:** It was not very simple but I've finally understood how it works and how to use await inside tests. I could not start my mocha tests yesterday because I tried to run my server before test, but I've found that mocha do it also. So i just removed npm start command before mocha test command and my test run successfully

### Day 6: June 09, 2018

### Day 7: June 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Implemented integration test for disconnect event

**Thoughts:** I think I need refactor my code in tests (especially console.log). Maybe I should use some kind of logger? I'll google it.
